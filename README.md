# Analyse your cycling data with Python


This repo consists of several notebooks to analyse cycling data from a .fit file.

## Contents

### Cycling data 1. Basics .ipynb 
This notebook is about the basics. You'll upload a .fit file and start doing some basic analysis of speed, cadence, heart rate and power (if available). You can make some basic graphs with it. Finally, store the data in a .json file format for later use. 

### Cycling data 2. Personal
By entering some personal data (age, weight, aerobic treshold) we can make some personal calculations and show it in a graph.

### Cycling data 3. Maps
Show your ride on a map - contains some issues

### Cycling data 4. Meewind and Tegenwind
Experimental Notebook to calculate bearing and 'tegenwind' en 'meewind'. Work in Progress.

### Cycling data 5. Helper script.


Use the 'plot fit files on maps' notebook to see your fitfile data plotted on a map.
