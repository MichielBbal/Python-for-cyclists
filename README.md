# Analyse your cycling data with Python


This repo consists of several notebooks to analyse cycling data from a .fit file.

## Contents

### Cycling data 1. Basics .ipynb 
This notebook is about the basics. You'll upload a .fit file and start doing some basic analysis of speed, cadence, heart rate and power (if available). You can make some basic graphs with it. Finally, store the data in a .json file format for later use. 

### Cycling data 2. Personal
By entering some personal data (age, weight, aerobic treshold) we can make some personal calculations and show it in a graph.

### Cycling data 3. Maps
Show your ride on a map - contains some issues

### Cycling data 4. Meewind and Tegenwind
Experimental Notebook to calculate bearing and 'tegenwind' en 'meewind'. Work in Progress.

### Cycling data 5. Helper script for winddata from OpenWeatherAPI 
Short script to use the OpenWeather API to load winddata. Unfortunately this can only be done during your ride, not afterwards as OpenWeather does not provide historical data. :-(
